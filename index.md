				<p>Dear Reader,</p>
				<p>I'd like to thank you for visiting my personal blog. I consider this blog to be a place where I can share my ideas and experiences with everyone. To make a navigation easier for you, I'll give the short outline of the blog structure.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The "scientific sandbox" section contains small interesting experiments in the areas of machine learning and computer science made for the sake of curiosity.</li>
					<li>The "social projects" section covers the projects, mainly in the area of education, in which I was/am involved.</li>
					<li>All the other ideas and experiences are collected in the "posts" section.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please feel free to contact me via either social networks or e-mail, should you have any suggestions on blog improvement or any other discussion points.</p>
				<p>Kind regards,</p>
				<p class="signature">Dmytro Kalpakchi</p>
