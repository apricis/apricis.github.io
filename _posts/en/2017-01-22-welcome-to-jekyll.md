<p>I decided to write the first post about the reason why I started this blog :smile:. All this blogging seems to be a waste of time which is already quite a scarce resource for all of us. However, it seems that writing posts is more advantageous than one can think initially. Firstly, you train to present your ideas, that are usually vague and complicated, in a clear and simple manner.

Secondly, writing blog posts facilitates the personal development and makes us learn many new and interesting things. Finally, during the day we have thousands of thoughts and we forget almost half of them. Therefor, the blog can become a good database of our thoughts and a platform for discussion with like-minded people.</p>
<p>TED conference is considered to be the best platform for discussing new ideas, thereafter I want to start this blog with a post containing a TED talk. I suggest you to watch the exciting talk that helps to learn that even frustration may facilitate our creativity and inspire us.</p>
